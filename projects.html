                A line follower robot is a robot which follows a certain path controlled by a feed back mechanism.
                The mechanical part or body of the robot can be designed using AutoCAD or Workspace. A basic Line follower robot can consist of a base at the two ends of which the wheels are mounted. 
                A rectangular sheet of hard plastic can be used as the base. For this project i used an arduino board as the microcontroller with IR sensors to diffrentiate between the surface and the lines.
                The infrared sensors keep the track of deviaton from the line and according to the margin of error the pid provide the correct turning angle to the wheels which then corrects the path.
